**Honors Enrolment Pre-assessment System (HEPaS) - Distributed Systems Project**

This is a simple distributed system created for an assignment during my final year of my bachelor's degree in February 2024.

- Designed and implemented a three-tier distributed system to allow students to self-assess eligibility for Honors studies.

- Built Client–Server architecture with two remote servers using synchronous RPC communication (XMLRPC).

- Developed backend services in Python for authentication, academic rule validation, and eligibility evaluation.

- Implemented a MySQL database to manage student academic records and integrated it via a dedicated database server.

- Supported both OUST (Open University of Science and Technology) and non-OUST users, including secure student verification, average calculations, and rule-based decision logic.

- Deployed and tested the system across multiple machines, demonstrating remote communication and fault handling.

***Technologies:*** Python, XMLRPC (RPC), MySQL, SQL, MySQL Workbench, VS Code
